## ABOUT ME
Purposefulness is my credo. At one time, in 4 years, I grew from an editor to the CEO of a large Russian online magazine on special equipment. But I left everything in 2016 to start a family.\
Now I don't want to go back to the old way. Today I am discovering the world of web development and my goal is to immerse myself in it completely!
